# timerFlip
Knockout extension for timed execution based on provided timer parameters

This is a timer flip which accepts a number of seconds and counts down until 0.
Use this to hide/show etc. behavior based on the observables tickerCounter & tickerRunning.
Start with tickerOn, set loop to the number of times you want to repeat.
Also setting a loopFn function would call that function on each loop.
